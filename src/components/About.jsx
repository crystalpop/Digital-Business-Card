            <p>Hi there! I currently a SWE student at UC Irvine. I am learning React in order to expand the options available to me when creating projects. I hope to be a well-rounded engineer with full-stack capabilities, although I do prefer the backend side of things. I love software engineering because it allows be to engage my creativity in solving interesting problems and creating impactful projects.</p>
